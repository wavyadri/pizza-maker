My initial idea was to replicate a custom pizza ordering app which has checkboxes for each topping and adjusts the price based on user input. I started off by skteching out my idea on paper and I knew I didn't want to stop there. This project was the perfect opportunity to strengthen my React skills and explore unknown features.

I created a quick wireframe on Adobe XD to guide me. I designed all of my pizza graphics in Canva. I organized all of my data in arrays in separate files.

The customer journey begins on the Home page, from which they have two options: Our Menu or Make Your Own.

I decided to follow and build out one path at a time. I began with Our Menu. 
First, I worked on the repeating components: Header and Navbar. I discovered how to dynamically render each header based on the url of the page which was pretty awesome! I also enjoyed googling around for more info on React Router during this setup phase, during which I came across useParams which I bookmarked for later.
Next, I built FullMenu (currently still has a placeholder image). Does anyone else love using the map method in React or is that just me? It's so statisfying to type out my element once they see it perfectly repeated and displayed on my screen!

To be continued...
