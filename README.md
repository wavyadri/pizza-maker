# PIZZA MAKER

My initial idea was to replicate a
custom pizza ordering app which has
checkboxes for each topping and adjusts
the price and image based on user input.
I wanted to include e-commerce elements
such as a cart-counter and checkout so I
began to sketch out my ideas on paper
which I find to be a useful first step
for all of my projects.
